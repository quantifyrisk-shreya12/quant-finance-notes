Bond Concepts and Financial Theory
Welcome to the Bond folder â€” a dedicated space to explore, analyze, and document key concepts in bond markets and fixed income finance. This collection is designed to deepen understanding of bond pricing, risk measures, and quantitative models used in practice.

ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Find Here
Bond Fundamentals: Definitions, types, and characteristics of bonds.

Pricing Models: Valuation techniques including discounting cash flows and yield calculations.

Interest Rate Dynamics: Overview of term structures, yield curves, and their modeling.

Risk Measures: Duration, convexity, and other sensitivity metrics.

Advanced Topics: Credit risk in bonds, callable and convertible bonds, and regulatory considerations.

Mathematical Frameworks: Stochastic models and analytical approaches relevant to fixed income instruments.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repository section serves as both a learning resource and a practical reference for students, practitioners, and researchers interested in fixed income finance. Notes are accompanied by mathematical derivations, real-world examples, and, where applicable, code snippets for quantitative analysis.

ðŸš€ Work in Progress
Content will be continuously expanded as I deepen my study and incorporate feedback. Contributions and discussions are welcome!
